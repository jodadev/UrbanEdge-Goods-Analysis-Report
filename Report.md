### **Conclusion**

    - **Popcorn Holder** and **World War 2 Gliders Assorted Designs** consistently rank as the top products in both revenue and volume.

    - Create bundles or promotions featuring these products to maximize their impact.

    - Identify other high-potential products that could benefit from increased marketing or improved pricing strategies.

3. **Target High-Volume, Low-Revenue Products:**
    - For products like the **Jumbo Bag Red Retrospot**, which have high volume but lower revenue, consider offering premium versions or adjusting pricing to increase revenue without reducing sales.

4. **Customer Retention and Engagement:**
    - Implement **customer loyalty programs** to encourage repeat purchases across the broader product range.
