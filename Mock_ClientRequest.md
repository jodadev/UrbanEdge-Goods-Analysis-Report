## Subject: Need Help Understanding Product Sales and Customer Trends
Hi,
My name is Laura, and I run UrbanEdge Goods, an online store offering various products. We've been in business for a while, and I feel like we're not fully leveraging our sales data to make informed decisions.

I’d love your help with the following:
1.	**Product Sales Analysis:**
    - Which products drive the highest sales volume and revenue?
    - Are there patterns in product sales over time (daily, weekly, or monthly trends)?
2.	**Customer Insights:**
    - Are there any patterns in how frequently customers make purchases?
    - Which customers are contributing the most to our revenue?

I believe the data we have — including transaction details, product names, prices, quantities, customer numbers, and country — should help with these analyses.

Please let me know how we can move forward and if you need any additional information.
Looking forward to your insights!

Best,<br/>
